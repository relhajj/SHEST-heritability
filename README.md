## Formatting input data:
* The expected file type format for SHEST_calculator.ipynb a comma-seperated-values file (extention: `.csv`)
* The file should have two columns. 
  * Column 1 contains the years while column 2 contains the incidence or prevalence values.
  * Rows 1 and 2 are used to store the data source(s)
* **For an example of an acceptable .csv file, refer to cystic_fibrosis.csv found in [relhajj/SHEST-heritability/csvs](https://github.com/relhajj/SHEST-heritability/blob/92acb4219c7ee84a49af64f883985fce5f8dd3b3/csvs/cystic_fibrosis.csv).**
